# MSKDDX
The Card Grid Layout with Modals.
The main area displays DDx items as individual "cards" arranged in a responsive grid. Each card shows the item number and title. (Snippets can be added but make card heights inconsistent, so omitted for initial simplicity). Clicking any card opens a modal (popup window). The modal displays the full details (number, title, full text) of the clicked item. The search bar filters the cards shown in the grid. Highlighting applies to titles in the grid and to both title and details within the modal. Updated Code (Save as .html and open in browser):
